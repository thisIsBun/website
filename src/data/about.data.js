I joined Alpha Camp’s web development course, and I found coding is like a detective who piecing clues together to solve puzzles. After graduated from Alpha Camp, I successfully transitioned into a front-end engineer role. && These days, I’ve been focused on delivering features that meet customer needs while maintaining clean, readable code. In my recent projects, I’ve worked on user authentication, enhancing web accessibility. && In my spare time, I love to write blogs to share and consolidate the skills I’ve picked up. && Here are a few tools I’ve been working with recently:",
